                <p>You take care of a teenager from the 13th century, you set a goal for yourself, it can be like trying to write his/her life in history, or maybe you will try to live as long as possible?!</p>

                <img src="img/faq.jpg" alt="tasks reminder" class="faq--img">
                
                <p>After pressing the button to add an adventurer <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">person_add</span>, his/her life cycle begins immediately.</p>
                <p>Every two seconds, the avatar becomes elder and loses a small amount of all stats and pays the cost of living in the amount of 2 coins, if the required amount is not available, the avatar will become a beggar, which will cause a significant decrease in stats, so keep an eye on the level of finances.</p>
    
                <ul>There are three main methods of obtaining finance:
                    <li>1) Working on a farm <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">grass</span> is the easiest way, where you spend strength and happiness to get a small compensation in money and food;</li>
                    <li>2) Working at a forge <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">construction</span> - consumes a significant part of health, strength, saturation and happiness, but you get a decent salary;</li>
                    <li>3) Go on an adventure <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">swords</span> - the most dangerous venture where you spend a large part of strength, saturation and health in exchange for a small monetary reward and an increase in happiness, but this is the only way to get fame and write the life of the avatar in history.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Maintaining vital indicators is the main problem of the game, when any indicator drops to zero, the avatar dies (gets a terrible disease, gets fatally overworked, dies of hunger or commits suicide).</p>
                <p>Health increases while feeding <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">restaurant_menu</span>.</p>
                <p>Strength increases while resting <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">self_improvement</span> in exchange for saturation.</p>
                <p>Saturation can be raised by feeding <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">restaurant_menu</span>, or maintained by working on the farm <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">grass</span>.</p>
                <p>Happiness can be obtained either by visiting a brothel <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">hotel</span> or by going on an adventure <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">swords</span>.</p>
                <p>Feeding <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">restaurant_menu</span> costs 10 coins, visiting a brothel <span class="material-symbols-outlined icon">hotel</span> costs 20 so sometimes it wouldn't be available.</p>
                <blockquote class="reminder">Remember: adventurers live short, but brightly and make history, while others live long but unhappy lives.</blockquote>
